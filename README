This directory contains several files relevant to operating on very
large data sets.

== Map Function in Bash ==

- map.sh - a map function implemented in Bash

When multi-core processors are the norm, it is only reasonable that we
ought to be able to parallelize even shell scripts.  This script
provides a means for operating in parallel on sets of files contained
in directories.

== Reservoir Sampling ==

- samplen.py - a reservoir sampler implemented in Python
- samplen.pl - a reservoir sampler implemented in Perl

Algorithms that perform calculations on evolving data streams, but in
fixed memory, have increasing relevance in the Age of Big Data.

The reservoir sampling algorithm outputs a sample of N lines from a
file of undetermined size. It does so in a single pass, using memory
proportional to N.

These two features -- (i) a constant memory footprint and (ii) a
capacity to operate on files of indeterminate size -- make it ideal
for working with very large data sets common to event processing.

While it has likely been multiply discovered and implemented, like
many algorithms, it was codified by Knuth's The Art of Computer
Programming.

The trick of this algorithm is to first fill up the sample buffer, and
afterwards, to probabilistically replace it with additional lines of
input.
